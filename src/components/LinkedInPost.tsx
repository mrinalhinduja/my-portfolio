        content: `Last week, I asked one of my senior team members: "How's it going with the new hires?"
      
      "Great! They're picking things up quickly," he replied.
      
      Then I asked: "If you gave them a project and stepped away for two weeks, would they deliver?"
      
      The silence said it all.
      
      Here's what I've learned at Ditto Insurance: 
      
      The real measure of leadership isn't how your team performs when you're watching, it's how they perform when you're not.
      
      Absence-based performance reveals:
      - Whether you've built capability or dependency
      - If you're developing decision-makers or task-followers 
      - Whether your team has ownership or just accountability
      
      The key question every leader should ask: "Am I building people who need me, or people ready to lead without me?"
      
      I have learnt this lesson much later in life, about creating future leaders and not followers.
      
      How do you test for true independence in your team?`,
